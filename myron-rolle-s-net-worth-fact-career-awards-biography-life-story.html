He once had dreams of being a first-round NFL draft pick. However, he skipped his senior season at FSU to accept a Rhodes Scholarship and spend the year studying at Oxford in pursuit of another dream: to become a brain surgeon. He was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the sixth round of the 2010 NFL draft and spent three years trying to make a career in the NFL before retiring in 2013 to go to medical school. Now 33, Rolle is battling his toughest opponent. “The numbers are staggering,” he said. And the staff there are facing the same shortages of protective equipment found across the country.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-birthplace-of-myron-rolle></span>What is the birthplace of Myron Rolle?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Myron Rolle was born on 30th October 1986 in Texas, the USA.
