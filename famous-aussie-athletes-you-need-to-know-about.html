From cricket to tennis, to rugby, the country has an impressive array of athletes on its roll of honor. These athletes are so prominent that every <a href=#>bookie</a> makes sure that people can rely on them to win games. Here we look at some of the most famous Australian sportsmen throughout history and some of the achievements that have made them so iconic in Australia and throughout the world.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cricket_Sir_Donald_Bradman></span><strong>Cricket: Sir Donald Bradman</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Perhaps the most iconic and beloved Australian sportsman of all time, Sir Donald Bradman is a name known to cricket fans all around the world. Widely regarded as the greatest cricket player in history, the Australian legend earned the title of ‘The Don’ from his adoring fans. He achieved a Test batting average of 99.94 – an incredible achievement. Playing for Australia for almost 20 years he represented his country in 52 tests, scoring 6,996 runs and averaging 110. In 2000, Bradman was voted the greatest cricketer of the 20th century by Wisden, the cricket authority.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tennis_Rod_Laver></span><strong>Tennis: Rod Laver</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rod Laver is arguably one of the best-ever Australian tennis players. Born in Queensland in 1938, he played a major role in Australian tennis dominance in the 1950s and 60s. Not to mention that he helped the country become the nation with the most Grand Slam titles. Laver is the only man to have won the Grand Slam twice and he is the only one to win the title five times. His clutch and powerful performances led him to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame and Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1981.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Rugby_John_Eales></span><strong>Rugby: John Eales</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The quintessential rugby player, John Eales was an integral part of Australia’s triumphs throughout the 1990s. He made his debut for the Wallabies in 1991 and was captain for six years. He led by example on the field and was a real inspiration to the players around him. His reliability and brave performances earned him the nickname ‘Nobody’, a reference to his fantastic consistency and endurance. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest players in rugby history.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cycling_Cadel_Evans></span><strong>Cycling: Cadel Evans</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Australian cycling has been dominated by Cadel Evans since his breakthrough in 1998. The rider won over 100 professional races, including the 2011 Tour de France, the world’s biggest cycling event. He was the first non-European to win the tour, and his victory was seen as a real breakthrough for cycling in Australia. Evans’ success highlighted the nation’s potential in the sport and made him a hero of Australian sport.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Surfing_Layne_Beachley></span><strong>Surfing: Layne Beachley</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One of the top female surfers in the world, Layne Beachley dominated the world of surfing for more than a decade. She won the world championship seven times, including the last five consecutively, from 1998-2003. She was a pioneer and helped progress women’s surfing to the levels it is seen today. Beachley is widely admired for her fierce determination and for her philanthropic work through her charity Aim For The Stars.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Athletics_Cathy_Freeman></span><strong>Athletics: Cathy Freeman</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cathy Freeman is one of the most iconic Australian athletes of all time. She achieved success in the 400-meter event and won the Gold Medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Her winning run was seen as a symbol of the country’s reconciliation and the athlete became the face of the Games. Her spirit and determination made her a national hero and she went on to become one of the most decorated athletes in the world.</p><p>The men and women mentioned above are just some of the incredible Australian sportsmen and women who have achieved success throughout history. Whether it be tennis, cricket, surfing, cycling, or athletics, the country has some of the world’s best athletes and it is a testament to all of the people mentioned here that they have brought so much success and pride to Australia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpajAqrHCnqOemqNjsLC5jZqsaJ6Rory2v4yarKyrmZp6osDHpZytnaNixrDBjKecnpxdqbxut82ormaZkqTCtXs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffamous-aussie-athletes-you-need-to-know-about.html&text=Famous%20Aussie%20Athletes%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffamous-aussie-athletes-you-need-to-know-about.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffamous-aussie-athletes-you-need-to-know-about.html&title=Famous%20Aussie%20Athletes%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffamous-aussie-athletes-you-need-to-know-about.html&title=Famous%20Aussie%20Athletes%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffamous-aussie-athletes-you-need-to-know-about.html&title=Famous%20Aussie%20Athletes%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffamous-aussie-athletes-you-need-to-know-about.html&description=Famous%20Aussie%20Athletes%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ken-leung-net-worth-how-much-is-ken-leung-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ken Leung Net Worth: How Much Is Ken Leung Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./diana-taurasi-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diana Taurasi Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
