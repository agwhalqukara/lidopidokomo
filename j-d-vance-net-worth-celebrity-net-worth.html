After that, he moved to San Francisco and became a venture capitalist in the city's tech industry. Before landing a job at a venture capital company, he spent a period working as the chief operating officer at a biotech company. It was through this biotech company that he first interacted with <a href=# title="Peter Thiel Net Worth">Peter Thiel's</a> VC firm Mithril Capital. In 2016 he left the biotech company to take a job as a a principal at Mithril Capital. This was the same year he released what would become a bestselling memoir, "Hillbilly Elegy." Because of the book's rising success, Vance did not spend much time at Mithril. He left in 2017 to work at the Washington, DC-based investment firm Revolution, which was founded by AOL co-founder, Steve Case. He spent the next 18 months at Revolution, during which time he was the lead partner in roughly a dozen deals. Some notable investments from this time include an AI company called Pryon and the aforementioned AppHarvest.</p><p>In 2019 Vance co-founded the Cincinnati-based firm Narya Capital.

The book chronicles his upbringing in Middletown, Ohio, and describes the socioeconomic hardships of his family and the wider Appalachian area. "Hillbilly Elegy" drew significant press for its depiction of white working-class values in the Rust Belt, especially because of its release in a controversial election year. It was also criticized by many for perpetuating myths about poverty and making generalizations about various groups of people. In 2020, the book was adapted into a film directed by <a href=#>Ron Howard</a> and starring <a href=#>Amy Adams</a> and <a href=#>Glenn Close</a>.</p><h2 id=hillbilly-elegy-royalties><strong>Hillbilly Elegy</strong> Royalties</h2><p>According to Vance's financial disclosures, he earned the following amounts in royalties from publisher Harper Collins thanks to his book Hillbilly Elegy:</p><ul><li>2020: $347,752</li><li>2021: $475,380</li></ul><h2 id=narya-capital><strong>Narya Capital</strong></h2><p>In 2020 J.D. launched a venture capital firm called Narya Capital.

According to its most recent filings, Narya has made around a dozen investments in everything from gene therapy to farming to space security. As we stated in an earlier paragraph, according to his 2022 financial disclosure, J.D. personally values his share of each of these investments in the $100-$250,000 range and at least one of them has already filed for bankruptcy (AppHarvest). Here are some of the known investments made by Narya:</p><ul><li>Hallow: A prayer app backed by <a href=# title="Mark Wahlberg Net Worth">Mark Wahlberg</a>.</li><li>Rumble: The anti-Youtube streaming video platform.</li><li>Chapter: A digital service aimed at helping senior citizens understand their Medicare plans and options.</li><li>Branch: An online insurance company.</li><li>Strive: An <a href=#>asset management firm founded by fellow Ohio conservative</a> and onetime potential VP pick, <a href=#>Vivek Ramaswamy</a>.</li><li>Kriya Therapeutics: A gene therapy biotech company.</li></ul><h2 id=us-senator><strong>US Senator</strong></h2><p>In the summer of 2021, Vance officially began running for the US Senate seat being vacated by Ohio Republican Rob Portman. Endorsed by Donald Trump, he went on to win the primary and the general election in 2022.</p><h2 id=trump-vp-pick><strong>Trump VP Pick</strong></h2><p>On July 14, 2024, J.D. Vance was chosen to be Donald Trump's Vice Presidential running mate.</p><h2 id=political-positions><strong>Political Positions</strong></h2><p>Described as a populist conservative, some consider Vance to be critical of LGBTQ+ rights, women's rights, and the reality of climate change. Vance has persistently opposed supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia. In a 2024 NY Times Op-Ed, Vance explained his position by claiming Russia's victory in Ukraine is inevitable and "that reality must inform any future Ukraine policy, from future congressional aid to the diplomatic course set by the president."</p><p>Vance was a vocal critic of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election, calling him "reprehensible" and "America's Hitler." However, he began changing his tune by 2018, and in 2020, he became a full-fledged supporter. Notably, Vance perpetuated the Big Lie that Trump lost the 2020 presidential election due to voter fraud.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In 2014, Vance married Usha Chilukuri, who had been his classmate at Yale Law. Together, they have three children.</p><p>Raised Protestant, Vance was baptized and confirmed in the Catholic Church in 2019.</p>Who's Richer? <a href=# title="Compare the networths of J.D.
