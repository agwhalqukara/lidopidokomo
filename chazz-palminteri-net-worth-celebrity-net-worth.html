Chazz Palminteri best known for his performances in such films as "A Bronx Tale," "The Usual Suspects," and "Bullets Over Broadway." For the latter film, he earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Palminteri has also appeared on television in shows including "Rizzoli & Isles," "Modern Family," and "Godfather of Harlem."</p><h2 id=early-life-career-beginnings><strong>Early Life and Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Chazz Palminteri was born as Calogero Lorenzo Palminteri on May 15, 1952 in the Bronx borough of New York City. His mother, Rose, was a homemaker, while his father, Lorenzo, was a bus driver. Palminteri is of Sicilian descent, with his grandparents having immigrated to the United States from Agrigento, Sicily in 1910. As a child, Palminteri experienced a somewhat formative event when he witnessed a mobster being murdered in front of his apartment building. However, he claimed to the police that he didn't see the attack.</p><p>Early on in his career, Palminteri struggled to make it as an actor. He split his time performing in off-Broadway plays and moonlighting as a bouncer. Subsequently, he landed bit parts in the films "Home Free All" and "The Last Dragon," and appeared in episodes of such shows as "Hill Street Blues," "Matlock," "Dallas," and "Wiseguy." In 1989, Palminteri had his breakthrough when he debuted his autobiographical one-man show "A Bronx Tale" at Theatre West in Los Angeles. The show went on to run for two months at Playhouse 91; much later, it would be turned into a Broadway musical also starring Palminteri.</p><h2 id=film-career><strong>Film Career</strong></h2><p>In the early 90s, Palminteri was in the comedies "Oscar," "Innocent Blood," and "There Goes the Neighborhood." His biggest part yet came in 1993, when he partnered with <a href=# title="Robert De Niro Net Worth">Robert De Niro</a> to adapt the play "A Bronx Tale" into a film. De Niro made his directorial debut with the movie, while Palminteri wrote the screenplay; both men also starred in the film. "A Bronx Tale" was both a commercial and critical success.

For his performance, Palminteri received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.</p><p>Another of Palminteri's most notable performances came in 1995, when he played Special Agent Dave Kujan in the mystery thriller "The Usual Suspects." Other credits in the 90s include the thrillers "Jade," "Diabolique," and "Mulholland Falls," and the comedies "The Perez Family," "A Night at the Roxbury," and "Analyze This."
