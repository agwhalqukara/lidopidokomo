In the late '80s, she began starring in Guess? ad campaigns, and the company's co-founder, Paul Marciano, credited Claudia with making the Guess? name "much more known around the world."

She also appeared in the 1994 documentary "David Copperfield: 15 Years of Magic." Claudia and David split up in 1999, and that year Schiffer won an undisclosed amount of money from a 1997 lawsuit she filed against "Paris Match" after the magazine claimed that her relationship with Copperfield was a sham.
